# Fraudulent job postings

Due to the large amount of modules imported, we have made a duplicate Google Colab notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tkvBHFZKgjELibboshSUl6sEP_rT4fTI?usp=sharing) for ease of running this notebook.

### Our objectives and the questions we intend to answer:

- Identify fake job postings by sentiment analysis.
- Which model is the best, in terms of metric scores, memory used and speed?
- Identify countries which are associated with fraud postings.
- Find associated features with a fraudulent and non-fraudulent posting.

*This project was submitted as part of the requirements of* ***EE0005 Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.***
