For easy viewing, the html version of the notebook is available.

The plotly visualisations do not show up in both ipynb and html versions, but they are viewable on Google Colab. (Weird)

Alternatively, the Google Colab version of this notebook can be run here:

The folder 'Screenshots used (if not loaded properly)' contains the images that we used in the notebook, in the event that the automated version does not load.
